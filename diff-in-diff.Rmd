# Introduction

The difference-in-difference approach is an extension of the analysis to estimate the effect of the exposure in the exposed (the average effect of the exposure in the exposed or ATT). 

Consider a cohort of exposed ($e=1$) and unexposed ($e=0$) individuals free of the outcome at baseline. Assuming conditional exchangeability, one would be able to estimate the ATT: Y^e=1^  -  Y^e=0^

However, what happens if both the exposed and the unexposed have some existing outcome before the exposure takes place? We will call the period when the exposure happens ($t*$), 
so that the time period $t < t*$ is the pre-exposure period 
and $t >= t*$ is the post-exposure period. Now the causal effect could be conceptualized as the "gain" or $\Delta$ in the outcome due to the exposure in the exposed had they not been exposed.

In the figure below, we use the sufficient component causes framework to represent the causal structure that generates our data at each time $t = 1 \ to  \ T$

![causal structure using sufficient component causes](/Users/luissegura/Dropbox/Diff in Diff/figure_1.jpg)

```{r, }
theme_set(theme_dag())

dagify(y ~ e + c,
       c ~ time, 
       e ~ time) %>% 
  ggdag
```

For this scenario, we will also assume that the $Pr(Y)$ will increase at each time $t$ due to other causes that are not the exposure. So that we will see an increase in the $Pr(Y)$ regardless of the exposure ever happened.

To generate such scenario, we need to notice Sufficient Cause 1. We will assume that only the prevalence of $C$ increases over time along the entire study period. Because SC1 is increasing over time, time $t$ (sufficient cause 6 or SC 6) is associated with an increase in the $Pr(Y)$. 

In this scenario, for every time $t$ when $t < t*$, the prevalence of the outcome $Y$ is determined by SC1, SC2, and SC4 in both the exposed group and the unexposed group. However, for the unexposed group the $Pr(Y)$ is also determined by SC1 ane SC2 during the period where $t >= t*$. 
Notice that SC3 has not yet been completed because the exposure $E$ happens at $t*$ for the exposed group. 

For every time $t >= t*$ the $Pr(Y)$ is determined by SC1, SC2, SC3, and SC4 only in the exposed group. 

```{r, echo = F }
### Create functions for Risk Ratios and Odds Ratios

# RR
risk_r<-function(p1, p2){
  (p1 + p2) / p1
}

# OR
or_<-function(p1, p2){
  ((p1 + p2) / (p1)) / ((1 - (p1 + p2)) / ((1 - (p1 + p2)) + p2))
}

# Exponential growth function
exp_fun<-function(x, r, t){
  x*((1+r)^t)
}

```



# Rules for Simulation

**Rule 1:** The prevalence of $C$ increases at each time $t$

**Rule 2:** $H$ and $Z$ remain constant over time

**Rule 3:** $Pr(Y) = 1$ if $(E \ and \ A)$ or $(H)$ or $(C \ and \ B)$ or $(Ä’ \ and \ Z)$

**Rule 4:** $E$ is a state-level (group) exposure and the $Pr(E) = 1$ if $(U)$

**Rule 5:** $U$ is a state-level (group) cause and is deterministic

**Rule 6:** $C$ is a deconfounder of $E$ and $Y$

**Rule 7:** $H$ causes $Y$ and is time-invariant. $H$ represents the difference in baseline risk betweeen $E$ groups

**Rule 8:** $time$ confounds $E$ and $Y$

**Rule 9:** $E$ happens only for the exposed group at time $t*$

**Rule 10:** There are multiple times $t*$ at which the exposure happens


We will simulate 15 states over a 20 year period. Two states will receive $E$ at t = 3, 4 states will receive $E$ at t = 5, 2 states at t = 9 and 2 states at t = 15. This is shown in the table below:

```{r, }

law_tab <- tibble(state = 1:15, 
                  e_yr = ifelse(state < 3, 3, 
                               ifelse(state > 2 & state < 7, 5, 
                                     ifelse(state == 7 | state == 8, 9, 
                                            ifelse(state == 9 | state == 10, 15, 100)))))


law_tab

```

Note that the exposure $E$ does not happen for 5 states during the study period, $t*$ > 20 for states 11 to 15.

## Prevalences of causal partners
```{r, }
### exponential growth function
growth <- function(x, r, t){
  x * ((1 + r) ^ t)
}

### create empty object to store the prevalence of C over time
pr_c <- rep(NA, 20)

### creating a vector for year
year <- 1:20

### the n of each state is going to be 10,000
state_size <- 10000

### number of observations per state during 20 years
n_years <- state_size * 20

### Estimate the prevlance of C exponentially
for(i in 1:length(year)){
  pr_c[i] <- growth(.14, 0.0678, i)
}

### plotting the prevalence of C over time
plot(year, pr_c)

pr_c


### creating a table with the prevalences of each causal partneer
rules <- tibble(year = year, 
                pr_c = pr_c, 
                pr_a = 0.20,
                pr_b = 0.10,
                pr_h = 0.10, 
                pr_z = 0.05, 
                pr_u = 1.00)

rules
```

## Setting the true causal parameters
With these rules we know the true causal parameters: the causal risk difference (RD = Y^e=1^  - Y^e=0^), causal risk ratio (RR = Y^e=1^ / Y^e=0^) and causal Odds Ratio (OR = odds(Y^e=1^) / odds(Y^e=1^))

Where Y^e=1^ = $Pr(A)*Pr(1-B)*Pr(1-H) + Pr(B)*Pr(1-H) + Pr(H)$

and Y^e=0^ = $Pr(Z)*Pr(1-B)*Pr(1-H) + Pr(B)*Pr(1-H) + Pr(H)$


```{r, }
rules %>% 
  mutate(y_e = (pr_a * (1 - pr_b) * (1 - pr_h)) + (pr_b * (1 - pr_h)) + pr_h, 
         y_ne = (pr_z * (1 - pr_b) * (1 - pr_h)) + (pr_b * (1 - pr_h)) + pr_h, 
         RD = y_e - y_ne, 
         RR = y_e / y_ne, 
         OR = (y_e / (1 - y_e)) / (y_ne / (1 - y_ne)))


```
