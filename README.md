# DiD_simulation

So, this is a first attempt to try to generate a dataset that has a data generating mechanism similar to what a DiD is trying to analyze. 

There are several things that still need to be done before attempting to write code to compare Christine and Melanie's method vs DiD Econ method with time-varying treatment timing, and that I would love your input.

First, revision of the causal model and if you agree or disagree. Please feel free to add/delete/comment as much as needed. 

Second, the calculation of causal parameters. My probability knowledge is rusty and probably gone, so let me know what you think. 

Third, the decisions about number of states, sample size, length of period of observation, etc

Fourth, the prevalence of the causal partners. 

And whatever else you think is needed/should be removed. I am looking forward to having more R fun in collaboration with you.
